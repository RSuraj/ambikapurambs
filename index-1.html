Vedas are spiritual thoughts pertaining to Hinduism believed to be have been written way back in 3000 BCE,by sages in Vedic Sanskrit. It contains powerhouse of knowledge originating in ancient Bharath.
There are four Vedas : the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samveda and the Atharvaveda. Vedas are called “Sruti”( what is  heard) , whereas other spiritual texts are called “Smriti”( what is remembered).
Each Veda has been classified into four major text types. They are:<br/>
A.	SAMHITAS   -- Contains mantras and benedictions,<br/>
B.	ARANYAKAS –Contains text on rituals ,ceremonies, sacrifices and symbolic sacrifices,<br/>
C.	THE BRAHMANAS—Has commentaries on rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices,<br/>
D.	THE UPANISHADS—Has texts discussing meditation, philosophy and spiritual knowledge.<br/>
</h3>

<h2><b><u>Origin of Maharudram</u></b></h2>
<h3>Yajur veda , famous for its ritualistic elegance and grandeur , is divided into Krishna Yajurveda  and Shukla Yajurveda.<br/>
Into Krishna Yajurveda , comes  1.Taittiriya Samhita ( consists of 8 kandas—while T.S. 4.5 & T.S.4.7  are Sri Rudram  Chamakam  and has  become very popular among South Indians )
<br/>
                                                         2.The Taittiriya Brahmana (consists of 3 kandas)<br/>
                                                         3.The Taittiriya Aranyaka ( consists of 7 prashras)<br/>
                                                         4.The Apastambha Shrautasutra<br/><br/>

Rudram is the most sacred means of worshipping Lord Shiva. There are four kinds of Rudra parayanam. Rudram,Ekadasa Rudram, Maha Rudram and Ati Rudram; Each has more significance comparing to the preceding ones. Ati means ultimate. Therefore it  is the ultimate form of worship of Lord Shiva.
<h2><b><u>How Maharudram is performed</u></b></h2>
<h3>
Ancient Sages have prescribed several ceremonies and austerities where Vedic Mantras are used for worship . One of such Mantras of high potency and power is called SRI RUDRAM of Taitriya Samhita of Sri Krishna Yajurveda . Samhita consists of seven 'cantos' containing 44 Chapters of 'Prasnas' . In the middle of the 4th Canto of this Samhita ' SRI RUDRAM' is the fifth chapter. This chapter is divided into 11 'Anuvakas' or paragraphs. It is a prayar to Lord Shiva praising His various attributes and qualities.The importance of Sri Rudram is that it occurs in the middle of the Taittiriya Samhita and in the central portion of Sri Rudram is to be found the greatest of the Mantras viz. THE PANCHAKSHARA MANTRA . Sri Rudram is therefore the holiest of holy Mantras. It is also called Namaka Prasnam as the word NAMAH occurs several times . It is also known as Shatharudriyam . It is recited not only for one's own purification and attainment of higher spiritual knowledge but also for bringing welfare to oneself and to the country as a whole.
<p>
Traditionally ,the seventh chapter of the 4th Cantos of Taittriya Samhita called the CHAMAKA Prasnam is also recited along with Sri Rudram Prasnam in which there is a prayer for seeking material benefits ranging from material needs such as food to eat , to achieve ultimate salvation . Constant repetition of Rudra mantras in the prescribed manner is called JAPA YAGNA . This Japa Yagna is followed by Abhishek ,Hawan and Archana to Lord Shiva by which the efficancy of Japa yagna is enchanced .
</p>
<p>
Sri rudram japam is normally done after an elaborate Anganyasa which is called MAHANYASA . Sri Rudram is then chanted eleven times and at the end , one Anuvaka of Chamaka Prasnam is chanted . Thus when Sri Rudram is chanted 11 times ,Chamakam is chanted once in full ; i,e.,the first eleven anuvakas of the seventh prasna of the 4th canto of Taitriya Samhita. Simultaneously , Abhishekam is also performed on a 'Shivalinga' chanting Sri rudra eleven times and Chamaka once. The significance is that ,the eleven forms of Lord Shiva viz: Mahadeva, Shiva, Rudra, Shankara, Neelalohita, Eashana, Vijaya, Bhima, Devadeva, Bhavodhbhava and Adtiiyatmaka Rudra,are invoked in eleven Kalasas (kumbham) when eleven Pundits chant Sri Rudra Mantra eleven times each according to the above procedure followed by one anuvaka of Chamaka . Then Hawan is performed chanting Rudra and Chamaka prasana in full and pouring pure cow's ghee into the fire in one unbroken stream chanting Chamaka Prasna called VASORDHARA . Abhishekam is also performed with the water sanctified in the eleven Kumbhams to the lord while the same is also sprinkled on all the devotees assembled to witness the Maharudra Yagna. Then Archana is performed with flowers and 'Bilwa' leaves with various Mantras . The Yagna is then concluded with Managala Arti and Mantra pushpanjali .
</p>
<p>
In the Rudrikadasini,as it is called ,Sri Rudra Mantra is chanted 121 times by the 11 pandits each chanting 11 times and the chamaka mantra is chanted 11 times,each pandit chanting once in addition to the chant required for Abhisheka ,Archana and Hawan . Eleven such (RUDRIKADASINIS) are required to be performed for a (MAHA RUDRA YAGNA);i.e., 11 pandits duly initiated and trained in Vedas and knowing the various Mantras required for chanting according to proper Swaras. At the time of Rudra Japa , there should be purity in all the three Karanas- Mano ,Vak and Kaya – Mind, speech and body . The Maharudram is usually done for 11 days but to save time depending on local conditions , it may be done in 4 or 5 days according to the availability of pandits,time and resources . 
</p>
<i>
Alternatively , 11 groups (GHANAS) of 11 Vedic Pandits each can conduct the Maharudra Yagna in one day also , each group performing one (RUDRIKASASINI). In essence, what is that we are going  to have is ,  there will be 121 Vedic Pandits in all for the 11 Ghanams.
</i>
</h3>
<h2><b><u>Glory of Rudram</u></b></h2>
<h3>
Maharudram is revered as the crown jewel and the essence of Yajur Veda.<br/>
<p>
Such is the prowess of the Rudram that the scriptures say that no misfortune, illness or such other bad elements can befall a town or village where even one practitioner of Sri Rudram hails the presence of Lords in fire, in water, in trees and plants and in the entire universe.
</p>
<p>
Besides leading us to the realization that Ishvara abides in all forms of Jiva, the Rudram also teaches the highest spiritual teachings that, all the distinctions of high, low bad, good ,are at the power , or vyavahaarika, level and when one rises to the higher level one transcends the narrow bounds of  virtue and vice.
</p>
<p>
Three –fold benefits are attributed to the yajnas:
</p>
1.	 To ensure the well-being for oneself through the grace of the divinities.<br/>
2.	To live happily in the world of the Devas after death.( Rewards 1 and 2 are related to one’s merits, punya , and will last only as long as the punya lasts.)<br/>
3.	When one performs the yajna without expecting any personal gain, it results in the purification of the mind and leads to the path of knowledge( jnana marga); the destination is moksha or release from the cycle of births and deaths or  a state of total bliss( ananda).<br/>
